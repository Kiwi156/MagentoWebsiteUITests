The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate being able to find and interact with different types of elements locators. 

Also another goal is to demonstrate an implict waits.

# Techniques Learned

This exercise demonstrates waiting for an element before we check it. During the tests for creating accounts there are methods that wait for text to appear. I have learnt that it is important in UI tests to know if a condition is being waited for and how to communcate the condition.    

This exercise also demonstrates finding element locators and interacting with different types of elements like buttons, links, a page tittle and input fields.
