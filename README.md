# Magento website UI tests using Serenity with Java

This exercise demonstrates **web browser automation** and has examples of **finding element locators** and interacting with different types of elements. 

The website is: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/ this is a demo site to test automation test scripts.  

# Goal

I think the goal of this exercise is demonstrate and explain explict and implict waits. 

Also another gaol is to be able to find and interact with different types of elements locators. 

# Techniques Learned

This exercise demonstrates waiting for an element before we check it. During the tests for creating accounts there are a methods that wait for text to appear. I have learnt that it is important for UI tests to know what conditions are being waited for and how to communcate them.
